1. Placement of the “Save Search” Action

The best location for a “Save Search” button is close to the query summary—typically on the right side of the result summary bar.

Recommended layout:
[ Results: 2,341 items ]   [ Sort ▼ ]   [ Save Search ★ ]
-------------------------- QUERY CHIPS --------------------------

Best practices:

Use a star icon (★) or bookmark icon for familiarity.

When clicked, it opens a small modal:

Name of saved search

Toggle for notifications

Confirm

Why: Users understand this instantly from patterns used by Google, ArcGIS, Amazon, GitHub, etc.

2. Saving a Search Should Capture the Full Query Context

A saved search must include:

Keywords

Applied facets

Spatial filters (AOI, place name, coordinates)

Sort order (optional)

Best practices:

Present a “preview” of what will be saved inside the modal:

Keywords: "Bridge damage"
Location: Custom Polygon
Filters: Sensor=Sentinel-2, Cloud<20%


Why: Removes ambiguity; users know exactly what will be triggered later.

3. Sharing a Saved Search

Every saved search should generate a share menu from two places:

Inside the “Saved Searches” page/drawer

As an option immediately after saving

UI pattern:

“Share” button or icon → opens share modal:

Copy tiny URL

Email link to colleague

Optional: share to teams (Slack, MS Teams, etc.)

Best practices:

Use a tiny URL format (short hash or GUID).

Provide visual confirmation (e.g., “Copied to clipboard”).

Include permissions logic if relevant (open to anyone? org-internal?).

Why: Sharing should be as frictionless as sharing a Google Map link.

4. Ability to Receive Email Notifications

Notifications must be part of the Save Search flow.

Modal should include:

Toggle: “Notify me when new results match this search”

Frequency options (if you support it):

immediately

daily digest

weekly

Best practices:

Keep defaults simple: “Notify me” (immediate).

Provide a small note:
“You will receive an email when new items appear that match this query.”

Why: It mirrors the UX of Google Alerts or Earthdata subscription services.

5. Saved Search Management Area

Provide a place to view and manage saved searches:

Accessible via user menu (top-right)

Or from a link in the results page

Each saved search should display:

Name

Query summary (chips)

Last run time

Number of new results

Actions:

Run

Share

Edit notifications

Delete

Best practices:

Show small data indicators:
“12 new results since last run.”

Why: Users often rely on saved searches as “subscriptions.”

6. Tiny URL / Small Sharing Link

To support an easy-to-share link:

Best practices:

Use a URL shortener pattern controlled inside the platform (never offload to external services).

Example:

https://voyager.ai/s/a8XkD4


Include encrypted parameters so the full query is not exposed.

UX guidance:

Provide a “Copy Link” button in both:

Save Search modal

Saved Search management page

Always use a toast notification confirming successful copy.

7. Inline Feedback After Saving

Once a search is saved, the UI should update immediately.

Best practices:

Change ★ icon to a filled version ★

Tooltip changes:
“Search saved. Click to manage or share.”

Offer the share button immediately.

Why: Reinforces the action without redirecting the user away from results.

8. Optional: Quick Access Panel for Saved Searches

Add a “Saved Searches” drawer accessible from the results page (similar to saved filters in enterprise tools).

Best practices:

When opened: list all saved searches

Allow quick switching to previous saved queries

Do not heavily clutter the page—the drawer should hide by default

9. Respect Minimalism

Because your landing page and results page aim to be clean and mission-focused, saved-search UI should be:

Small

Non-intrusive

Using simple modals and icons

Avoiding banner-level UI or persistent toolbars

10. Messaging & Assistance

Provide tooltips or small guidance:

On Save: “Save searches to get alerts when new matching data is available.”

On Share: “Anyone with this link can view search results (access permitting).”

This ensures transparency, especially for sensitive environments.
