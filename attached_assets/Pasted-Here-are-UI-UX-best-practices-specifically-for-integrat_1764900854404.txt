Here are **UI/UX best practices** specifically for integrating **Saved Searches** into a geospatial search results page—covering *save, share, notifications,* and *tiny URLs*—while keeping the interface clean, modern, and mission-appropriate.

---

# 🌟 **Best Practices for Adding “Saved Search” Functionality to the Results Page**

---

# **1. Placement of the “Save Search” Action**

The **best location** for a “Save Search” button is close to the **query summary**—typically on the right side of the result summary bar.

### Recommended layout:

```
[ Results: 2,341 items ]   [ Sort ▼ ]   [ Save Search ★ ]
-------------------------- QUERY CHIPS --------------------------
```

### Best practices:

* Use a **star icon** (★) or bookmark icon for familiarity.
* When clicked, it opens a small modal:

  * Name of saved search
  * Toggle for notifications
  * Confirm

**Why:** Users understand this instantly from patterns used by Google, ArcGIS, Amazon, GitHub, etc.

---

# **2. Saving a Search Should Capture the Full Query Context**

A saved search must include:

* Keywords
* Applied facets
* Spatial filters (AOI, place name, coordinates)
* Sort order (optional)

### Best practices:

* Present a “preview” of what will be saved inside the modal:

  ```
  Keywords: "Bridge damage"
  Location: Custom Polygon
  Filters: Sensor=Sentinel-2, Cloud<20%
  ```

**Why:** Removes ambiguity; users know exactly what will be triggered later.

---

# **3. Sharing a Saved Search**

Every saved search should generate a **share menu** from two places:

1. Inside the “Saved Searches” page/drawer
2. As an option immediately after saving

### UI pattern:

“Share” button or icon → opens share modal:

* Copy tiny URL
* Email link to colleague
* Optional: share to teams (Slack, MS Teams, etc.)

### Best practices:

* Use a **tiny URL format** (short hash or GUID).
* Provide visual confirmation (e.g., *“Copied to clipboard”*).
* Include permissions logic if relevant (open to anyone? org-internal?).

**Why:** Sharing should be as frictionless as sharing a Google Map link.

---

# **4. Ability to Receive Email Notifications**

Notifications must be part of the **Save Search** flow.

### Modal should include:

* Toggle: **“Notify me when new results match this search”**
* Frequency options (if you support it):

  * immediately
  * daily digest
  * weekly

### Best practices:

* Keep defaults simple: *“Notify me” (immediate)*.
* Provide a small note:
  *“You will receive an email when new items appear that match this query.”*

**Why:** It mirrors the UX of Google Alerts or Earthdata subscription services.

---

# **5. Saved Search Management Area**

Provide a place to view and manage saved searches:

* Accessible via user menu (top-right)
* Or from a link in the results page

### Each saved search should display:

* Name
* Query summary (chips)
* Last run time
* Number of new results
* Actions:

  * Run
  * Share
  * Edit notifications
  * Delete

### Best practices:

* Show small data indicators:
  *“12 new results since last run.”*

**Why:** Users often rely on saved searches as “subscriptions.”

---

# **6. Tiny URL / Small Sharing Link**

To support an easy-to-share link:

### Best practices:

* Use a URL shortener pattern controlled inside the platform (never offload to external services).
* Example:

  ```
  https://voyager.ai/s/a8XkD4
  ```
* Include encrypted parameters so the full query is not exposed.

### UX guidance:

* Provide a “Copy Link” button in both:

  * Save Search modal
  * Saved Search management page

* Always use a **toast notification** confirming successful copy.

---

# **7. Inline Feedback After Saving**

Once a search is saved, the UI should update immediately.

### Best practices:

* Change ★ icon to a filled version ★
* Tooltip changes:
  *“Search saved. Click to manage or share.”*
* Offer the share button immediately.

**Why:** Reinforces the action without redirecting the user away from results.

---

# **8. Optional: Quick Access Panel for Saved Searches**

Add a **“Saved Searches” drawer** accessible from the results page (similar to saved filters in enterprise tools).

### Best practices:

* When opened: list all saved searches
* Allow quick switching to previous saved queries
* Do not heavily clutter the page—the drawer should hide by default

---

# **9. Respect Minimalism**

Because your landing page and results page aim to be clean and mission-focused, saved-search UI should be:

* Small
* Non-intrusive
* Using simple modals and icons
* Avoiding banner-level UI or persistent toolbars

---

# **10. Messaging & Assistance**

Provide tooltips or small guidance:

* On Save: *“Save searches to get alerts when new matching data is available.”*
* On Share: *“Anyone with this link can view search results (access permitting).”*

**This ensures transparency, especially for sensitive environments.**

---

# 🎯 **If you want, I can now design the full UI flow:**

* Save Search modal
* Share Search modal
* Saved Search list page/drawer
* Tiny URL pattern
* How the chip-based query is captured

Just tell me whether you want:

* **Low-fi wireframes**
* **Mid-fi prototypes**
* **Finalized text labels + UI copy**
